A Custom Launcher focused on local development for the Dead Zone Revive Project.

# How to Use

1. Run the [Dead Zone Server](https://github.com/SwitchCompagnie/DeadZone-Server-OLD)
2. Open the Launcher

P.S: The Launcher will always look for the server in the `http://localhost:8080/` if you want to change it you need to recompile-it

# Todo

- [ ] Add Debug Options
- [ ] Migrate to Tauri
